# Using Feature Flags in a Remix Application

This is a companion app for the following [blogpost](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/04/01/feature-flags-in-remix/) that's meant to show how to use [ConfigCat's Feature Flags](https://configcat.com) in Remix. 

To demonstrate how we can use [ConfigCat](https://configcat.com/) feature flags in a [Remix](https://remix.run/) application, we will start by building a simple Remix app that pulls trending news stories from the popular Hacker News website using the unofficial Hacker News Search API on Algolia.

## Build & Run

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm run dev
```
This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see the page.
