# Using Feature Flags in a Remix Application

To demonstrate how we can use [ConfigCat](https://configcat.com/) feature flags in a [Remix](https://remix.run/) application, we will start by building a simple Remix app that pulls trending news stories from the popular Hacker News website using the unofficial Hacker News Search API on Algolia.

Read the step-by-step guide in the [blogpost.](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/04/01/feature-flags-in-remix/)

## Run app

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
