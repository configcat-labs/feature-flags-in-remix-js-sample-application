# Using Feature Flags in a Remix Application

To demonstrate how we can use feature flags in a Remix application, we will start by building a simple Remix app that pulls trending news stories from the popular Hacker News website using the unofficial Hacker News Search API on Algolia.

Here is the blogpost: https://configcat.com/blog/2022/04/01/feature-flags-in-remix/

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see the page.
